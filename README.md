# Vocabulary Flashcard

VocabularyQuiz is a mobile app designed to help users improve their vocabulary skills through interactive quizzes and study materials. In this app, users can create decks with flashcards, where each flashcard consists of a word from a language and its corresponding meaning (explanation).

The app features five main fragments, accessible from the bottom navigation view:
-Home fragment:
Users can view their created decks, flashcards, and last quiz results.
Users can also create new decks to organize their study materials effectively.

-Search fragment:
Users can easily search through their decks and flashcards, making it convenient to find specific words or meanings.


-Favourites fragment:
Users can mark their favorite decks, allowing quick access to essential study materials.


-Study mode fragment:
Users can select one or more decks and engage in a study session to review the flashcards.
The flashcards are randomly shuffled, and users can tap on the rotate button to see the back side of each flashcard, revealing its meaning.


-Quiz mode fragment:
Users can select one or more decks to initiate a quiz session and test their knowledge.
The quiz presents questions based on the selected decks, and users can review their quiz results upon completion.



Study Session:
During a study session, users can conveniently loop through randomly shuffled flashcards, allowing them to focus on their learning without repetition.
Users can utilize the flip functionality to view the explanations of specific flashcard words.
Additionally, users can mark flashcards, designating them as important for later review. These marked flashcards are accessible in the home fragment.

Quiz Session:
In the quiz session, users must answer questions based on the selected decks.
Upon completion, users can review their quiz results, providing valuable feedback on their progress.
All quiz results are stored and easily accessible in the home fragment.
